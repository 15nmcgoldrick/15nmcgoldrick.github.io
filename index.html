      <h2> WUHOOOOOOOHH YOUVE BEEN TRICKED!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
      <h3> heres some random information i found on google. The dachshund (UK: /ˈdæksənd/ or US: /ˈdɑːkshʊnt/ DAHKS-huunt or /ˈdɑːksənt/[2]) is a short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed.

The standard size dachshund was developed to scent, chase, and flush out badgers and other burrow-dwelling animals, while the miniature dachshund was bred to hunt smaller prey such as rabbits. In the United States, they have also been used to track wounded deer and hunt prairie dogs.

Dachshunds also participate in conformation shows, field trials and many other events organized through pure-bred dog organizations such as the American Kennel Club (AKC). According to the AKC, the dachshund remains one of the top 10 dog breeds in the United States. While you are probably used to seeing red, black & tan and dappled Doxies, did you know they come in 15 colors and 6 marking combinations? Colors include: black & cream, black & tan, blue & cream, blue & tan, chocolate & cream, chocolate & tan, cream, fawn (also called Isabella) & cream, fawn & tan, red, wheaten, wild board, black, chocolate and fawn. Marking combinations include: brindle, dapple, sable, brindle piebald, double piebald and piebald.
